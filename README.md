## AI Models & Algorithms

Hygieia employs a variety of machine learning and deep learning models to provide accurate disease predictions:

| Disease | Algorithms | Accuracy | Key Features |
|---------|------------|----------|--------------|
| Diabetes | Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM | 92.5% | Glucose Level, BMI, Age, Insulin |
| Heart Disease | XGBoost, Neural Networks, Logistic Regression | 94.2% | Cholesterol, Blood Pressure, ECG Results |
| Liver Disease | Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost | 89.7% | Bilirubin, Enzymes, Proteins |
| Lung Cancer | CNNs, Random Forest, SVM | 91.3% | Smoking History, Age, Genetic Risk |
| Breast Cancer | Random Forest, SVM, KNN | 93.8% | Cell Perimeter, Area, Texture, Concavity |
| Parkinson's | XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest | 90.2% | Voice Features, Tremor Analysis |
| Kidney Disease | Gradient Boosting, Random Forest | 92.1% | Creatinine, Blood Urea, Albumin |

All models undergo rigorous validation using k-fold cross-validation, confusion matrix analysis, ROC curve evaluation, and precision-recall metrics.
